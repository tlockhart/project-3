This place is tucked away and once you walk in, it's like you've stepped into a Korean home.  Very welcoming, warm and inviting.\\n\\nIt's very vegetarian friendly!  The soft tofu is stewed and put into the dol sot pots which each and every stew feels like it's custom made for you. \\n\\nYou can select from beef, seafood or mixed meats (seafood & beef), mushroom, and just plain.  They can adjust the spice as needed too.  I always get the extra hot with the hot temperature, can't beat it.  The rice also comes in a dol-sot which is great if you leave it in for a while, it burns the rice into a nice crispy shell.  DROOL.\\n\\nJust thinking about this place makes my mouth salivate!  \\n\\nIf you're not into tofu, they also offer korean bbq meats (cooked in the back), with other soup/stew items.\\n\\nLove this place!!!   \n",

It seems if you come in here more than once a week, she'll know you're name but I haven't been so lucky since my visits are a bit more sporadic.\\n\\nMy most recent discovery are the vegetarian breakfast sandwiches, which are served all day! I particularly enjoy veg. sausage w/ havarti on an everything bagel. I could actually go for one right about now... I've also had the veggie club sandwich and my other half has enjoyed the chicken cheesesteak hoagie and the chicken salad on a croissant. Everything always taste fresh, they are priced really well  (I think my favorite bagel sandwich I mentioned is $2.09-2.99- cheaper than wawa!). The people at the deli are super helpful, offering menus if you can't read the one on the wall and will make great suggestions and accommodations to your needs and want.\\n\\nDon't forget to grab a really great snack too while you're there- they have amazing chocolate bars, an incredible drink case, tons of chip varieties and those addictive hi-chew candies in every flavor.\\n\\nI know i'll be back here, who doesn't like fast / delicious / attentive service?   \n",
      "3  I moved from Chicago to Philadelphia over a year ago.  Everybody here raves about the restaurants, but I have yet to find many that deserve five stars, or even four.  This is the best restaurant I have eaten in in Philadelphia.  \\n\\nTahini and bread  arrived at the table, and I thought, hum, plain but I'm hungry.  They must put crack in that Tahini.  I wanted to lap it out of the bowl like an uncouth dog.  The bread is excellent too.\\n\\nI love a menu with many organic meat choices.  How often can you order an organic beef shishkabob?  It was superb.  The meat done perfectly, the onions nearly caramelized but not quite so they still had some substantive crunch.  The purslane salad tasted like I was eating a plant in the middle of a garden.  It is not often that I dream about a salad but I do dream about this one\\n\\nMy husband had a chicken dish with black eyed peas and green peas and fantastic rice.  I won't begin to describe the flavoring; it is beyond my culinary vocabulary.  We asked what spices they use, and in addition to traditional zatar, they use their own blend of spices.  I don't even need to know what is in it just so long as we can keep coming back and ordering it again and again.\\n\\nI was so full but ate dessert none the less, which I usually don't do.  But when a diner is this good, I had a feeling the desserts would be too and I just needed to find out.  Pistachio creme brulee.  It could have come out over the top, but no indeed.  It was pure pistachio heaven in s super light yet rich custard.  Heaven. Heaven.\\n\\nOur service was superb.  The squeezed us into a last minute Friday night reservation with the caveat that we would need to get through our dinner in an hour and 15 minutes in order to accommodate a reservation made prior to us.  Given the time constraints they never made us feel rushed and timed the meal perfectly.  Then my husband left to go to the restroom, the waiter picked up his napkin and refolded it nicely on the table.  Do I care about the napkin placement in the middle of a meal?  Not really, but it is a sign that the waitstaff is incredibly attentive and extremely well trained.  \\n\\nMy eating out plan for Philly might just be to skip eating most everywhere most of the time so I can frequent this expensive, though appropriately priced restaurant.  Kudos to the chef.   \n",

But, don't let the modest face fool you, this place rocks!\\n\\nMenu is creative and fully customizable. Burgers are cooked on a flattop, perfectly seared, juicy, slightly charred. Fries are hand cut, fried fresh, perfectly crispy and salty. What more could you ask for from a burger place? \\n\\nPro tip - Download the SPOT app for a rewards program and some good coupons (aka free fries!).   \n",

I got a bubbly and my fiancee got some Italian orange soda.  We got the lamb sausage, potato chips, and crab stuffed peppers as \"snacks\" then i got the mozzarella with prosciutto bacon bits sandwich which was delicious and savory while being light and healthy. service was prompt and polite.  rustic, intimate, and cozy wine lounge atmosphere with low to medium noise level.  bathroom door lock and handle are kind of confusing to use at first. would definitely recommend for lunch!   \n",

When you go, just let Hassan make something for you, don't try and overwhelm yourself with the different options. Make sure to get a chaat and a lassi as the two really complement one another.   \n",

We only popped in for gelato, but I would love to come back for the pizza! It looked and smelled really good. Gelato was amazing, as capogiro gelato always is. Highly recommend chocolat scurio and pera as a combo--it was perfect!   \n",
