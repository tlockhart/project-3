I got a bubbly and my fiancee got some Italian orange soda.  We got the lamb sausage, potato chips, and crab stuffed peppers as \"snacks\" then i got the mozzarella with prosciutto bacon bits sandwich which was delicious and savory while being light and healthy. service was prompt and polite.  rustic, intimate, and cozy wine lounge atmosphere with low to medium noise level.  bathroom door lock and handle are kind of confusing to use at first. would definitely recommend for lunch!\n",

      "I love a menu with many organic meat choices.  How often can you order an organic beef shishkabob?  It was superb.  The meat done perfectly, the onions nearly caramelized but not quite so they still had some substantive crunch.  The purslane salad tasted like I was eating a plant in the middle of a garden.  It is not often that I dream about a salad but I do dream about this one\n",

      "My husband had a chicken dish with black eyed peas and green peas and fantastic rice.  I won't begin to describe the flavoring; it is beyond my culinary vocabulary.  We asked what spices they use, and in addition to traditional zatar, they use their own blend of spices.  I don't even need to know what is in it just so long as we can keep coming back and ordering it again and again.\n",

      "I was so full but ate dessert none the less, which I usually don't do.  But when a diner is this good, I had a feeling the desserts would be too and I just needed to find out.  Pistachio creme brulee.  It could have come out over the top, but no indeed.  It was pure pistachio heaven in s super light yet rich custard.  Heaven. Heaven.\n",

      "Our service was superb.  The squeezed us into a last minute Friday night reservation with the caveat that we would need to get through our dinner in an hour and 15 minutes in order to accommodate a reservation made prior to us.  Given the time constraints they never made us feel rushed and timed the meal perfectly.  Then my husband left to go to the restroom, the waiter picked up his napkin and refolded it nicely on the table.  Do I care about the napkin placement in the middle of a meal?  Not really, but it is a sign that the waitstaff is incredibly attentive and extremely well trained.  \n",

      "4. Originally, our little group headed to Franklin Fountain and the line was around the block-- Capofitto was only a few steps away with no line (and bonus--cheaper/better dessert treat!). We only popped in for gelato, but I would love to come back for the pizza! It looked and smelled really good. Gelato was amazing, as capogiro gelato always is. Highly recommend chocolat scurio and pera as a combo--it was perfect!\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Yum! This is a great place to go with a few friends to share their delicious and nicely portioned cheese while enjoying a beer from their extensive drink list. 5 stars purely because of how much I loved their cheese selection and appreciated the staff's knowledge of each cheese.  I'd happily go back although this is not a place I'd go to have inexpensive drinks.\n",

      "My most recent discovery are the vegetarian breakfast sandwiches, which are served all day! I particularly enjoy veg. sausage w/ havarti on an everything bagel. I could actually go for one right about now... I've also had the veggie club sandwich and my other half has enjoyed the chicken cheesesteak hoagie and the chicken salad on a croissant. Everything always taste fresh, they are priced really well  (I think my favorite bagel sandwich I mentioned is $2.09-2.99- cheaper than wawa!). The people at the deli are super helpful, offering menus if you can't read the one on the wall and will make great suggestions and accommodations to your needs and want.\n",

      "\n",
      "3. I love this food truck. They have the tastiest street foods like their captain crunch tilapia burrito. Who would've thought of that? The fried fish is so flakey and delicious, paired with fresh cabbage, tomatoes, avocado and Sriracha mayo. I have also tried their katsu and curry chicken which are so rich in flavor. Their Thai tea is also on point! So much to offer from a small food truck. I live in Jersey and I have driven here many times just to get food. They are so friendly and provide great food at a great price.\n",

      "\n",
      "The food was yummy - not earth shattering perhaps, but definitely a good range and interesting for a fixed course meal.  We chose the spicy chicken and the beef kabobs, and they were probably the best two courses (well besides baklava and mint tea being so awesomely delicious).  We also called ahead and found out that although they now have a full bar, you can still bring in a bottle of wine.  Definitely a good deal - heads up that some of the servers seem rather confused about the policy.\n",

I had never tried falafels prior to my visit to the the Falafel Nazi/ Falafel King (I know this is not PC, and no offense is intended), but it is an appropriate title to give him. It doesn't just communicate how great the food is, but the experience you'll have. \n",

We got there at 11:45 and still had to wait 40 minutes. \n",

All was delicious. There were six in our party and the bill was 42 bucks. We brought a couple bottles of wine and after tip had a great authentic dinner for under 10 bucks each.\n",

      "3. Beautiful shop; hands down one of the best ones I've ever seen. It's very modern and chic in a way. Love the creativity of the door handle being a rolling pin, the light fixtures as wire whip mixers, and incorporating the love sign into a beautiful center piece for the top back wall. Everything was very artsy and creative. I noticed the bright displays of cupcakes and assorted treats and most of all, the gorgeously decorated occasion cakes (HINT HINT: weddings are their specialty). They blew me away! It's like something you'd only see on TV! \n",
      "\n",
      "We couldn't resist ordering their uniquely flavored cupcakes. Chocolate cake with raspberry icing and lavender something with pistachio icing. Plus, if you find a purple center in your cupcake, you can get another one for free. (Definitely NOT a marketing scheme, but I admire the game even though we're being played.)\n",
      "\n",
      "To get to the point: the first thing I tried was the icing.. it was literally so hard I had to dig my teeth into it to get a bite. I feel like I would've like it if it was softer and more like icing? The chocolate cake was like any other. My fiancÃ©e's cupcake was strange!! The icing literally tasted like stale, natural butter (or maybe more closely similar to lard!? If you ever tasted lard, you'll know that distinct flavor it has.) The icing was also hard as a rock. However, the lavender mixed (don't know what with) cake wasn't half bad, though nothing stood out to me as special.\n",

      "Iffy on whether or not we'll be back. I want to like this place, but that just might be the pastry enthusiast in me talking.\n",

      "\n",
      "5. Cake Life is one of my favorite bakeries-and I've only been there once! I ordered the chocolate chip walnut cookie, while my sister ordered the Campfire Cocoa cake. We received the Fiesta cake by accident, and the server was kind enough to allow us to keep both slices of cake. The cookie was crispy on the outside but chewy on the inside. Could've used a little bit more sea salt but the chocolate chips were so fudgey and rich so I didn't have much to complain about. The campfire cake was delicious. The cake is moist and fluffy, while the whipped cream is chocolatey. Reminded me of the days I'd come back home from school on a winter day and I'd rip one of those Swiss Miss packets open into warm milk. The buttercream is made with Swiss Miss by the way! The Fiesta cake is a bit more dense, with a cream cheese frosting. Definitely an enjoyable experience. The shop itself is very cute and beautiful. I'll be returning... very soon!\n",

      "3. Showed up Saturday at 745 for dinner with friends.  Guy running the tiny dining room informs us that they stop seating at 730 on Saturday, but that we could order food to go, disclaiming that it takes about 20-30 min to prepare the food.  No problem.  So there we are, my friends, their 2 year old, and myself, waiting there outside on 6th street.  The front of the place opens to the street, so we're basically standing around trying not to ogle to hard at the people at the tables.  Odd thing is, the guy who took our orders intermittently chats us up, so he's aware that we are there waiting for something.  After 45 minutes, my friend asks about the status of our food and he acknowledges and trots off to the kitchen to see.  He emerges, sans food, approaches us matter of factly and informs that the food won't be ready for perhaps another hour!  No kidding.  Now I know about culture gaps, but this guy was born in Philly, he told us so.  Even so, there's never an excuse to treat customers like they or their own time doesn't matter.  100% non apologetic and indifferent to our inconvenience.  Food could be great. But I know I'll never be finding out.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. I don't know how long I've been saying that if the world was ending or if I was dying, the first thing I'd do is rush to Vetri. Thankfully, neither scenario happened, and I was privileged to finally dine there last night. \n",
      "\n",
      "With that being said, I obviously preemptively put Vetri Cucina on a pedestal surrounded with unrealistic hype. I had butterflies the moments leading up to my visit of combined sheer giddiness and nerves, that I would somehow be let done. I'm ecstatic to report that my dining experience at Vetri was one of the top dining experiences of my lifetime, and I found it to be truly everything everyone says it is, and more. \n",
      "\n",
      "Upon entry to the restaurant, I was actually a little uncertain. The hallway was narrow, and I had to walk through a crowd to get to the hostess stand. That literally was the lowlight of the evening, and that's not even horrible. Every aspect of the evening was stellar from there-on-out. \n",
      "\n",
      "Where to begin? Well, to start, I wish I was taking notes. Our server was so knowledgeable that I wish I could've written down everything he said about the food and the wine. The wine paring was extraordinary from the thorough to description to the actual pairing. I had the six-pour pairing and I'd absolutely recommend going that route. I didn't view the actual list until after the meal, I didn't realize that they literally listed the wines and dishes they paired with on the page. This is a great keepsake, and guide for my own future pairings. \n",
      "\n",
      "After our aperol spritz, we started with a few \"snacks\" and a vegetable cruditÃ©s platter for the table. We passed the veggies and helped ourselves to the snacks from the center of the table. Our next course, after the bread, was our antipasti. I didn't realize the plate in front of me was my tuna crudo, and mine alone. Theoretically, a group could share and pass everything. We did, to some extent, however we mostly ate the plate in front of us. Based on specific wine pairings, this does make sense.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Taking a step back, before our tasting journey began, our server gave us some time to discuss the menu and our preferences. I was told to \"not be shy\" if there was something I really wanted to try. While the tasting menu had the element of surprise at every course, the meal was centered around that initial conversation with the server. From just looking at the menu, there were a few standouts that I simply needed to try. \n",
      "\n",
      "After the antipasti- we moved on to multiple rounds of pasta. Mamma mia! The swiss chard gnocchi with brown butter was one of the most exquisite things I've ever eaten in my entire life. The gnocchi melted in my mouth as the flavor of the brown butter sauce lingered. This was served with the tortellini with truffle sauce that would've been a knockout on its own. I received the mafaldini with lamb shank ragu as my second pasta course. This was my must-have, and while delicious, the gnocchi still takes the cake. Special shout out to the delectable seafood in the tonnarelli al Frutti di mare that I sampled for one of the other plates\n",
      "\n",
      "At this point in the meal, I was starting to hurt, however there was no looking back. No food down, no food left behind. Of course, I had to sample the next round of bread that came out- the sourdough. No regrets either. \n",
      "\n",
      "I rallied in time for our secondi; in my case, the milk fed veal with asparagus- yet another standout from my initial menu review. I've said this before about veal, however, we have a new winner. This was the BEST veal I've had in my life. We had two different preparations of this tender, tender meat. One was more tender and filet-like, the other was delectably fattier with a slight crisp. There was a dollop of sauce, however I preferred the veal in its own juices. \n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, we reached dessert status. Based on our groups eagerness to try everything, our server ended up bringing us one of each dessert option. The pistachio flan was placed in front of me, and the pistachio that oozed out of the flan upon dipping my fork was a highlight. We literally based the plates around the table and it was great to try a little of everything. I hit crazy status when the little pastry tray was placed in the center. Did I need to try one of everything? Probably not, but when at Vetri, you try to eat it all. \n",
      "\n",
      "While the food was phenomenal, the staff added to the entire experience. Aside from our fantastic server, the team work and collaboration of guest service was apparent. We had so many people interacting with us throughout the meal that were aiming to please and perfectly harmonized with the actions of their colleagues. \n",
      "\n",
      "I was smiling on the outside and smiling on the inside. This meal is a true highlight in my culinary life.  So, I'm so thrilled the world isn't ending and I'm not dying. While I've checked a major item off my bucket list, it's only left me with the taste for more of the finer Vetri Cucina dining experience.\n",

      "1. One day after a really long 2 hour class, I was incredibly hungry. I am not a big food truck eater and after walking by I decided, eh why not?  I figured I would order and go home. I ordered the Mexican Chicken Platter and headed to my car. The aroma of the of the warm food had me wanting just a small bite. I figured one small bite and go home and enjoy the rest. Well see, sometimes things do not go according to plan! I couldn't stop eating. One bite just wasn't enough! You see I was so incredibly hungry and this was so incredibly awesome. I finished eating most of the dish and the feel good relaxed chemicals in my brain started flowing.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Greek to its core. Nice atmosphere. Full and bustling. Service a little harried and inconsistent.\n",
      "\n",
      "After great hummus I came to find that, as I was eating my appetizers and entrees, I just really don't like greek food that much. Not a knock on the restaurant, maybe more so my taste buds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Flat face.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Best egg whites and cheese in town!  Speedy, friendly service.  And for those of us that have to work while hungover on the weekends, this truck is a lifesaver.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only problem I have with them is that they don't make coffee.  (This really only merits deduction of half a point but since that's not an option I have to round down).  But really, it's not difficult to make and it would bring in SOOOOO much more money.  This is a college campus  where all the undergrads and grad students are zombies without coffee...\n",
      "\n",
      "Come on, Bui's, make coffee so I can give you that extra star.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. The atmosphere was charming and relaxed. Service by Eliz was incredible; she was attentive, accommodating and quick to serve. She gave us updates and was fully knowledgeable about the dishes. The flavors were savory, balanced and well-developed. The portions were so filling, we took home doggie bags.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Perfect place to fill your tummy after a long tour at the penitentiary!  If you're longing for that Greek comfort food, this is the place. \n",
      "\n",
      "The day we visited the penitentiary was freezing cold and we were starving.  So we decided to go with the $33 grilled meat sampler for two.  Oh, and the octopus appetizer for $8.  They serve you a gimongous piece of warm fresh bread upon seating with olive oil.  It was so inviting.  We finished that octopus in 1 minute!!  The tender pieces of juicy charred octo swimming in the olive oil and vinegar...man, I could've eaten 4 more of these all by myself.  The grilled meat platter was HUUUUGE!  I'm drooling just thinking about it.  We devoured them all.  And finished it off with Greek coffee and kantaifi.  Mmmm, it tasted so perfectly sweet with the nuttiness of the walnuts.  The tiny side of whipped cream I believe was home made.  And that combo just made my day.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Please go check it out, it's worth a trip!\n",

      "===== ROMANTIC REVIEWS =====\n",
      "\n",
      "1. I love wine, so this is a favorite spot for me.  I have met a date many times here during happy hour for a glass of wine (or more), accompanied by some classy appetizers.  If you're a fan of wine and cheese, this is the spot for you.  I never have a full dinner here, but it's a great place to sip a glass of wine, have delicious fancy snacks, and chat with friends. The atmosphere is hip.  When you get a two person table, it also has a romantic and intimate vibe, which makes it good for a date.  Highly recommended!\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Would have been better but overcrowded was not how I wanted to start the night.  Saying that we grabbed a seat at the bar, had a glass of wine each and shared a starter (crostini with goat cheese and a homemade pesto).  Very nice.  A good way to start the evening but nothing special.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Special was my companion for the evening.  Sugar was on my arm yet again for another shot at best date ever.....read the other review from this night to see if we achieved it\n",
      "\n",
      "3. For a vinophile living in Philly, Tria is true love. \n",
      "\n",
      "Happy hour wine specials are just ok... BUT the cheese specials are great!\n",
      "\n",
      "4. It's ridiculous and a little shameful how many first dates I've had at Tria locations.  It's a great spot to grab a glass of wine, but the minimum per glass is $8 - $9.  Decide to do one of their delicious salads or paninis - everything is around $12 each.  So, depending on how much wine you end up drinking, a byob might be your better choice, but the food is always excellent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tria - stands for the 3 fermented food/drinks of beer, wine, and cheese.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. I have been begging my friend to come to Sunday School at Tria with me for months but we always would end up doing something else.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, we went.  And I loved!\n",
      "\n",
      "We sat outside on a warm fall night and chatted while we people watched.\n",
      "\n",
      "The waiter was extremely knowledgeable about the wine and cheese--as he should be!!\n",
      "\n",
      "The wine and cheese complimented each other perfectly.  BUT what really made the cheese shine was the local honey that was served on the side.  Pure bliss.  I'll be back :-)\n"
